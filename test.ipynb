      " An agentic RAG is a type of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that incorporates an agent to manage and optimize the retrieval and generation processes. In traditional RAG systems, a retriever fetches relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base, and a generator creates a response based on the retrieved information. However, in an agentic RAG, an agent is introduced to enhance the system's capabilities.\n",

      "3. Response generation and refinement: The agent can work with the generator to create more coherent, accurate, and contextually relevant responses. It can also refine the generated responses by adding missing information, correcting errors, or improving the overall quality of the output.\n",
